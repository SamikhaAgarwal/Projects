This project goal is not to build an ideal model for stock
market prediction, but to test whether the feature of social
media sentiments contributes to the stock market analysis,
and to assess its predictive power.

• Use DJIA stock data and performed sentiment analysis.
• Applied Granger Causality and found positive correlation between twitter sentiments and 
stock price movement.
• Implemented in Python and R
